#  SRender

SRender is a software rasterization application written from scratch in C++11 with minimal dependencies (except win32 for display image) for windows platform. The purpose of writing this renderer is mainly for better understanding basic CG knowledge and algorithms. 

The number of core codes is about 2000 lines, so it's easy for studying or reading. You can feel free to make changes on this project.  Here some screenshots of SRender:

## Main Features

* Blinn-Phong shading
* Perspective correct interpolation
* Back-face culling
* early-z
* Homogeneous clipping
* Cubemap skybox
* Physically based rendering (PBR)
* Metallic-roughness workflow
* Image-based lighting (IBL)
* movable camera

## Binaries for Usage

The pre-built binaries can be found in bin folder. You can start with binaries and obj assets. (Note: the obj folder should be placed in the parent directory of binaries)

The obj models folder be downloaded from here:

## Build

If you want to check more details of SRender, the cmakelists.txt file is provided for building project files using [CMake](https://cmake.org/).

For visual studio:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017" ..
```



Another way is directly opening the SRender file with [CLION](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/), it will automatically configure the project.

Notice: use multibyte not unicode! Remember to change your setting for win32 file

## Control of Camera

* Rotation: holding left mouse button
* Pan: holding right mouse button
* Zoom: mouse wheel
